# 2nd_term_final
My submission for the Second term final exercise on OOP. To run the program, download all the files to a folder, open it in the terminal and run the command "g++ *.cpp -lncurses". When compiled succesfully, the executable "a.out" will be generated. NOTE that you need the ncurses library and (obviously) thr g++ compiler.
